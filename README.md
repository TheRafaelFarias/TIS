Tis is a really simple compiler created to test my skills, as time pass I will add more functions or logical

## How to run it
First, you need to put a phrase you want in `code.txt`

And to run you can use 
<pre><code>yarn build</code></pre>
to generate the compiled file, and to run the compiled file you can use

<pre><code>yarn runner</code></pre>
